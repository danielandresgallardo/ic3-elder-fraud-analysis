    "text": "3\nINTRODUCTION\nDear Reader,\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) is a central intake\npoint for victims to report fraud. IC3 shares the complaints it receives with FBI field offices and other\nlaw enforcement and regulatory agencies for further investigation or action, as appropriate. Along with\nthe Department of Justice’s Elder Fraud Initiative and other partners, the FBI is continually dedicated\nto identifying the perpetrators of these schemes and bringing them to justice.\nEvery day, the IC3 receives thousands of complaints reporting a wide variety of schemes, many of them\ntargeting seniors. These complaints are analyzed and aggregated to identify trends and help develop\nstrategies to combat these schemes and protect potential victims from loss.\nIn 2022, total losses reported to the IC3 by elderly victims increased 84% from 2021. Tech and\nCustomer Support schemes continued to be the most common type of fraud reported, with 17,800\ncomplaints filed by victims over 60. Monetary losses due to Investment Fraud reported by victims over\n60 increased over 300%, more than any other kind of fraud, largely due to the rising trend of crypto-\ninvestment scams. In almost every crime type tracked by the IC3, losses involving cryptocurrency\nincreased. Overall, cryptocurrency-related losses reported by the elderly increased by 350%.\nAs in previous years, the FBI is publishing the 2022 IC3 Elder Fraud Annual Report in hopes of bringing\nawareness to this problem and preventing future victimization. I encourage you to share the\ninformation from this report with your friends and families and take the opportunity to talk about\nthese scams.\nWe also encourage the public to report any internet-related fraud, even attempted fraud, to the IC3\nas soon as possible. Providing detailed information, including complete summaries and financial\ntransactions, assists the FBI with investigating and disrupting the frauds that are devastating our\ncitizens."

Two categories of fraud\nreported to the IC3, Tech/Customer Support and Government Impersonation, are\nresponsible for over $1 billion in losses to victims.\nCall centers overwhelmingly target the elderly, with devastating effects. Almost half\nthe victims report to be over 60 (46%), and experience 69% of the losses (over $724\nmillion). Victims over 60 lost more to these scams than all other age groups\ncombined, and reportedly remortgaged/foreclosed homes, emptied retirement accounts, and\nborrowed from family and friends to cover losses in these scams. Almost 100 elderly victims reportedly\nlost over $1 million to these\nVictims Losses Trend\nscams, while the majority\nGovernment Impersonation 3,425 $136,500,338 97%\nlost between $1,000 -\nTech and Customer Support 17,810 $587,831,698 147%\n$10,000.\nTOTAL 21,235 $724,332,036\nWhile the number of victims and losses from Government Impersonation scams are significantly lower,\nthe fraud tends to occur over a longer period as it takes the victim longer to realize they are caught in\na scam. Tech and Customer Support scammers take advantage of victims’ unfamiliarity with\ntechnology, online banking, and newer payment methods, like cryptocurrency, to quickly take as much\nmoney as possible. It is not uncommon for the scammers to execute a combination of the two scams\nor re-victimize a previous victim with the other form of scam.\nThe scams primarily emanate from call centers in\nCall Center Frauds -Victims Over 60\nSouth Asia, mainly India. In response to the increasing\nvictimization, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Losses Victims\nFBI are collaborating with law enforcement in India,\n25,000 $800,000,000\nsuch as the Central Bureau of Investigation in New\nDelhi and local Indian states, to combat cyber-enabled $700,000,000\nfinancial crimes and transnational call center fraud. 20,000\n$600,000,000\nThis cooperation has secured the testimony of U.S.\nvictims of call center fraud for use in enforcement\n$500,000,000\n15,000\nproceedings against the alleged perpetrators.\n$400,000,000\nIn 2022, with the assistance of U.S. law enforcement,\n10,000\nIndian law enforcement accomplished multiple call $300,000,000\ncenter raids, disruptions, seizures, and arrests of the\n$200,000,000\nindividuals alleged to be involved in perpetrating 5,000\nthese cyber-enabled financial crimes and global $100,000,000\ntelemarketing frauds.\n0 $0\nTo learn more about these types of scams, please see\nthese 2022-published Public Service Announcements\non the IC3 website and recently published podcast on FBI.gov4\n4 See Appendix D: Referenced Publications"

They comprise of advanced fee frauds, Ponzi\nschemes, pyramid schemes, market manipulation fraud, real estate investing, and\ntrust-based investing such\nas pig butchering. Investment\nOver 60 Victim Losses Past 3 Years\nTrust-based Investment scams represent the\nbiggest portion of losses for investment in\n$1,200,000,000\n2022. These scams often target individuals\nonline and most commonly involve a form of\n$1,000,000,000\ncryptocurrency. The scammers aim to gain the\nvictim’s trust and offer an opportunity to\ninvest in a low-risk, and unusually high-yield $800,000,000\ntype of scam. Victims over 60 are pressured\ninto accessing their retirement accounts, the\n$600,000,000\nequity of their home, or even convinced to go\ninto debt to invest as much money as possible\ninto the fraudulent scheme. This can be $400,000,000\ndevastating to elderly victims as their income\nis typically limited and many lose their entire\n$200,000,000\nlife savings. 5\nMore than 4,500 victims over 60 reported\n$0\nlosses slightly under $1 billion.\n2020 2021 2022\nLottery/Sweepstakes/Inheritance\nIn 2022, the IC3 received over 2,300 reports of elderly victims in\nLottery/Sweepstakes/Inheritance scams. Victims lost almost $70 million to these\ntypes of fraud.\nThe initial contact in a Lottery/Sweepstakes scam is often a call, an email, a social\nmedia notification, or a piece of mail offering congratulations for winning a big\ncontest, lottery, or sweepstakes the victim did not enter. To claim their prize, the victim is required to\npay upfront fees and taxes. The subjects will continue to call victims for months or even years,\npromising the big prize is only one more payment away.\nInheritance scams function very similarly as the victim is informed an unknown, distant relative has left\na large inheritance to the victim. The victim is required to pay taxes and fees to receive the inheritance\nmoney.\n5 See Appendix D: Referenced Publications"

    "text": "14\nConfidence/Romance Scams\nConfidence/Romance scams encompass those designed to pull on a victim’s\n“heartstrings”. In 2022, the IC3 received reports from 7,166 victims over 60 who\nexperienced almost $419 million in losses to Confidence/Romance scams.\nRomance scams occur when a criminal adopts a fake online identity to gain a victim’s\naffection and confidence. The scammer uses the illusion of a romantic or close\nrelationship to manipulate and/or steal from the victim. The criminals who carry out Romance scams\nare experts at what they do and will seem genuine, caring, and believable. The scammer’s intention is\nto quickly establish a relationship, endear themselves to the victim, gain trust, and eventually ask for\nmoney. Scam artists often say they are in the military, or a trades-based industry engaged in projects\noutside the U.S. That makes it easier to avoid meeting in person—and more plausible when they\nrequest money be sent overseas for a medical emergency or unexpected legal fee.\nGrandparent Scams also fall into this category, where criminals impersonate a panicked loved one,\nusually a grandchild, nephew, or niece of an elderly person. The loved one claims to be in trouble and\nneeds money immediately. In 2022, almost 400 victims over 60 reported Grandparent scams, with\napproximate losses of $3.8 million.\nConfidence/Romance Over 60 Victim Losses Past 3 Years\n2022\n2021\n2020\n$0 $100,000,000 $200,000,000 $300,000,000 $400,000,000\nExtortion\nExtortion occurs when a criminal demands something of value from a victim by\nthreatening physical or financial harm or the release of sensitive data. Extortion is\nused in various schemes reported to the IC3, including email extortion attacks,\nhitman schemes, government extortion, and sextortion. In 2022, over 4,200 victims\nover 60 reported incidences of extortion, with losses over $15.5 million.\nAlmost half of extortion victims over 60 reported to be victims of sextortion. Most believed they were\nin a relationship with the victim and shared sensitive photos or information which were then later used\nto sextort them."

The\ncombination of online shopping and social media creates easy venues for scammers\nto post false advertisements. Many victims report ordering items from links\nadvertised on social media and either receiving nothing at all or receiving something completely unlike\nthe advertised item.\nCryptocurrency\nIn 2022, the IC3 received almost 10,000 complaints from victims over 60 involving\nthe use of some type of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or\nRipple. Losses of these victims totaled over $1 billion.\nCryptocurrency is becoming a preferred payment method for all types of scams –\nSIM Swaps, Tech/Customer Support fraud, Employment schemes, Romance scams,\nand even some Auction fraud. It is extremely pervasive in Investment scams, where\nlosses can reach into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per victim.\nThe largest losses among\nOver 60 Losses Reporting Cryptocurrency Past 3 Years\nvictims over 60 are\ncryptocurrency-related\nInvestment scams, which 2022\naccounts for approximately\n2021\n66% of all losses related to\ncryptocurrency for this age 2020\ngroup. Call Center fraud, such\nas Tech and Customer Support\nscams and Government\nImpersonation, are second\nwith approximately 15% of\nlosses associated to\ncryptocurrency.\nThe IC3 published multiple\nPSAs depicting how\ncryptocurrency is exploited in\nfrauds and scams, particularly\nthe use of cryptocurrency\nATMs, crypto investments, and crypto support impersonations.6\n6 6 See Appendix D: Referenced Publications"

    "text": "21\nAPPENDIX C: TIPS FOR PROTECTION\n• Recognize scam attempts and end all communication with the perpetrator.\n• Search online for the contact information (name, email, phone number, addresses) and the\nproposed offer. Other people have likely posted information online about individuals and\nbusinesses trying to run scams.\n• Resist the pressure to act quickly. Scammers create a sense of urgency to produce fear and lure\nvictims into immediate action. Call the police immediately if you feel there is a danger to yourself\nor a loved one.\n• Be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, mailings, and door-to-door service offers.\n• Never give or send any personally identifiable information, money, jewelry, gift cards, checks, or\nwire information to unverified people or businesses.\n• Make sure all computer anti-virus and security software and malware protections are up to date.\nUse reputable anti-virus software and firewalls.\n• Disconnect from the internet and shut down your device if you see a pop-up message or locked\nscreen. Pop-ups are regularly used by perpetrators to spread malicious software. Enable pop-up\nblockers to avoid accidentally clicking on a pop-up.\n• Legitimate customer, security, or tech support companies will not initiate unsolicited contact with\nindividuals; nor, demand immediate payment or require payment via prepaid cards, wire transfers,\ncryptocurrency, or mailed cash.\n• Never give unknown, unverified persons remote access to devices or accounts.\n• Be careful what you download. Never open an email attachment from someone you do not know\nand be wary of email attachments forwarded to you.\n• Take precautions to protect your identity if a criminal gains access to your device or account.\nImmediately contact your financial institutions to place protections on your accounts and monitor\nyour accounts and personal information for suspicious activity.\n• Legitimate lotteries and beneficiaries do not need to pay upfront taxes and fees to claim a prize or\ninheritance. Playing foreign lotteries in any form is a violation of federal law.\n• Be careful what you post and make public online. Scammers can use details shared on social media\nand dating sites to better understand and target you.\n• Government or law enforcement officials will not demand payment by cryptocurrency, prepaid\ncards, wire transfers, or overnight mailed cash, nor contact a subject by phone to notify they are\nunder investigation."
