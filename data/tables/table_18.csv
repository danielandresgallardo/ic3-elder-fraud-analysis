,Romance scams occur when a criminal adopts a fake online identity to gain a victim’s
,affection  and  confidence.  The  scammer  uses  the  illusion  of  a  romantic  or  close
relationship to manipulate and/or steal from the victim. The criminals who carry out Romance scams,
"are experts at what they do and will seem genuine, caring, and believable. The scammer’s intention is",
"to quickly establish a relationship, endear themselves to the victim, gain trust, and eventually ask for",
"money. Scam artists often say they are in the military, or a trades-based industry engaged in projects",
outside  the  U.S.  That  makes  it  easier  to  avoid  meeting  in  person—and  more  plausible  when  they,
request money be sent overseas for a medical emergency or unexpected legal fee.,
"Grandparent  Scams also fall into this category, where  criminals impersonate  a panicked loved one,",
"usually a grandchild, nephew, or niece of an elderly person. The loved one claims to be in trouble and",
"needs money  immediately.  In  2022,  almost  400 victims over  60  reported  Grandparent  scams,  with",
approximate losses of $3.8 million.,
