APPENDIX C: TIPS FOR PROTECTION,
•,Recognize scam attempts and end all communication with the perpetrator.
•,"Search  online  for  the  contact  information  (name,  email,  phone  number,  addresses)  and  the"
,"proposed  offer.  Other  people  have 
likely  posted 
information  online  about 
individuals  and"
,businesses trying to run scams.
•,Resist the pressure to act quickly. Scammers create a sense of urgency to produce fear and lure
,victims into immediate action. Call the police immediately if you feel there is a danger to yourself
,or a loved one.
•,"Be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, mailings, and door-to-door service offers."
•,"Never give or send any personally identifiable information, money, jewelry, gift cards, checks, or"
,wire information to unverified people or businesses.
•,Make sure all computer anti-virus and security software and malware protections are up to date.
,Use reputable anti-virus software and firewalls.
•,Disconnect from the internet and shut down your device if you see a pop-up message or locked
,screen. Pop-ups are regularly used by perpetrators to spread malicious software. Enable pop-up
,blockers to avoid accidentally clicking on a pop-up.
•,"Legitimate customer, security, or tech support companies will not initiate unsolicited contact with"
,"individuals; nor, demand immediate payment or require payment via prepaid cards, wire transfers,"
,"cryptocurrency, or mailed cash."
•,"Never give unknown, unverified persons remote access to devices or accounts."
•,Be careful what you download. Never open an email attachment from someone you do not know
,and be wary of email attachments forwarded to you.
•,Take  precautions  to  protect  your  identity  if  a  criminal  gains  access  to  your  device  or  account.
,Immediately contact your financial institutions to place protections on your accounts and monitor
,your accounts and personal information for suspicious activity.
•,Legitimate lotteries and beneficiaries do not need to pay upfront taxes and fees to claim a prize or
,inheritance. Playing foreign lotteries in any form is a violation of federal law.
•,Be careful what you post and make public online. Scammers can use details shared on social media
,and dating sites to better understand and target you.
•,"Government or law enforcement officials will not  demand payment  by  cryptocurrency,  prepaid"
,"cards, wire transfers, or overnight mailed cash, nor contact a subject by phone to notify they are"
,under investigation.
