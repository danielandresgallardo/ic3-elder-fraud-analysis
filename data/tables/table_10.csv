more information regarding IC3 data.
* Regarding BEC victim losses: A whole number is given to depict the overall victim loss and is then broken out
into separate counts to identify when a victim over 60 may be reporting victimization on behalf of a business or
personally.
"** Regarding Ransomware adjusted losses, this number does not include estimates of lost business, time, wages,"
"files,  equipment,  or  any  third-party  remediation  services  acquired  by  a  victim.  In  some  cases,  victims do not"
"report any loss amount to the FBI, thereby creating an artificially low overall ransomware loss rate. Lastly, the"
number  only  represents  what  victims  report  to  the  FBI  via  the  IC3  and  does  not  account  for  victims  directly
reporting to FBI field offices/agents.
